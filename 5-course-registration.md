# Course Registration

Embarking on your university journey means taking charge of your course registration. While this responsibility might seem daunting, with the right approach, you can navigate it smoothly and set yourself up for success.

📚 Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Essential Resources

Before diving into registration, equip yourself with the following resources:

First Year Planning Guide: This comprehensive guide provides detailed information on course selection and degree requirements.

Steps to Registration: This guide outlines the registration process, including how to check your eligibility and resolve any holds on your account.

Aurora Registration Tutorials: These tutorials offer step-by-step instructions on using the Aurora system for course registration.

🗂️ Step 2: Plan Your Courses in Advance

Compile Course Reference Numbers (CRNs): List the CRNs of the courses you intend to take each term. This preparation allows for quick and efficient registration once your registration time opens.

Use the Course Catalogue and Class Schedule: Access these through your Aurora account to explore available courses, prerequisites, and scheduling options.

⏰ Step 3: Understand Your Registration Time

Registration Time: Your assigned registration time determines when you can begin registering for courses. This is based on factors like your academic standing and student status.

Summer Term Registration: For the Summer term, registration is open to all students after the initial week, so your specific registration time is less critical.

🛠️ Step 4: Resolve Any Holds on Your Account

Check for Holds: Before your registration time, ensure there are no holds on your account that could prevent you from registering.

Address Holds Promptly: If you find any holds, contact the appropriate office immediately to resolve them.

🧭 Step 5: Navigate the Waitlist System

Waitlist Functionality: If a course is full, you can add yourself to the waitlist. If a spot becomes available, you'll be notified via your UM email.

Waitlist Position: Your position on the waitlist indicates your order; however, this is not a guarantee of a spot in the course.

Eligibility for Waitlisting: Ensure you meet all prerequisites and co-requisites before adding yourself to a waitlist.

🧾 Step 6: Confirm Your Registration

Finalizing Registration: After adding courses, review your selections and confirm your registration.

Regularly Check Your Schedule: Monitor your class schedule to ensure all courses are correctly registered and no conflicts exist.

💡 Additional Tips

GPA Considerations: A higher GPA can improve your registration time for Fall and Winter terms.

Transfer Credits: If you're transferring from another institution, ensure your credits are properly recorded to avoid registration issues.

Seek Assistance: If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to contact the First Year Centre or your academic advisor for guidance.

By following these steps and utilizing available resources, you can navigate the course registration process with confidence and set a solid foundation for your academic journey.
