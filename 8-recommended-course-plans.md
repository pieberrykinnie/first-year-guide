# Recommended Course Plans
*This is a highly opinionated guide based on the CSSA executive team's personal experience and years of observations from our Discord community. Never finalize your schedule before consulting an [academic advisor](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/advising/#current-students).*

## For Students Starting in Fall
**Goal**: Complete requirements by May-June to declare your major before July registration.

### Critical Sequencing Rules
1. **Must take in Fall**: 
   - COMP 1010 
   - MATH 1500
2. **Must take in Winter**:
   - COMP 1020 
   - MATH 1700
3. **Must take in Fall OR Winter**:
   - MATH 1300
4. **Flexible timing** (Fall/Winter/Summer):
   - MATH 1240
   - STAT 1150
5. **Plus one additional course** (typically a Writing elective) to reach 24 credits

### Summer Course Reality
- Summer has two condensed sub-terms: **May-June** and **July-August**
- Courses meet 300 minutes/week instead of 150 minutes/week
- **Recommendation**: Take only one course per sub-term

### Standard Schedule
```markdown
Fall (12 credits):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150

Winter (12 credits):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1240
- [W] Writing elective

Summer (Backup):
- MATH 1240 (if not completed in Winter)
```

### Tryhard Option (Only if confident!)
```markdown
Fall (15 credits):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150
- COMP 1500 (CS Field Survey) OR COMP 1002 (Useful Tools)

Winter (15 credits):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1240
- [W] Writing elective
- COMP 1600 (CS & Society) OR COMP 1006 (Productivity Tools)

Summer (6 credits):
- COMP 2140 (Data Structures)
- COMP 2400 (Systems Programming)
- COMP 2080 (Analysis of Algorithms)
```

> **Important**: You aren't expected to do 5-course terms. Only attempt this if you have prior programming/calculus experience or transfer credits.

### Safer Schedule (Less math/programming confidence)
```markdown
Fall (12 credits):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1080 (Intro to Proofs)  ← Prepares for MATH 1240
- STAT 1150

Winter (12 credits):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150 (if not taken Fall)

Summer (3 credits):
- MATH 1240
```
*Why MATH 1080?* This easier Fall course introduces MATH 1240 concepts, making the "hardest first-year course" more manageable later.

---

## For Irregular Start Terms
*Key principle: Sync with the next Fall cohort instead of rushing. Prioritize COMP courses as they fill fastest.*

### Starting in Winter
```markdown
1st Winter (9 credits):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- Elective (e.g., [W] course)

Summer (3 credits):
- MATH 1240 (recommended solo)

1st Fall (9 credits):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- Elective/MATH 1240 (backup)

2nd Winter (9 credits):
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150
- Elective/MATH 1240 (backup)
```
*Why this works*: Most students prefer MATH 1240 solo in Summer. This keeps you to ≤2 computation-heavy courses per term. Use electives for Arts requirements.

> Alternative: High achievers could attempt second-year MATH/STAT courses later. Possible but not recommended: COMP 1020 in second summer + second-year COMP courses.

### Starting in Summer
```markdown
1st Summer (6 credits):
- COMP 1010 (May-Jun)
- COMP 1020 (Jul-Aug)  ← Take separately

1st Fall (9-12 credits):
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150
- Elective (e.g., MATH 1080)

1st Winter (9 credits):
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1240
- Elective (e.g., Arts course)

2nd Summer (Backup):
- MATH 1240 (if needed)
```
*Elective note*: Optimal to take 2 Arts courses (one Writing) in Fall/Winter.

### Extended Pathway (1.5-2 years to declare)
```markdown
Year 1 Fall (9 credits):
- COMP 1000 (CS Communication)
- MATH 1080 (Proofs Prep)
- Elective

Year 1 Winter (9 credits):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- Elective

Year 1 Summer (3 credits):
- MATH 1240

Year 2 Fall (9 credits):
- COMP 1020 (or COMP 1010 backup)
- MATH 1700 (or MATH 1500 backup)
- Elective/MATH 1240 backup

Year 2 Winter (9 credits):
- STAT 1150
- MATH 1300
- Elective/Backup course

Year 2 Summer (Backup):
- MATH 1240 or STAT 1150 backup
```
> COMP 1000/MATH 1080 are preparatory and don't count toward major requirements.

## Final Notes
1. **Every path is valid**: Your journey is unique - don't compare to others
2. **Declare promptly**: Use [Aurora](https://aurora.umanitoba.ca) or the [Science Advising form](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/advising/#current-students) once you complete 24 credits
3. **Backup strategy**: Register for courses in future terms while taking prerequisites
4. **Full-time status**: Requires 9 credits/term (adjust if scholarships demand more)
