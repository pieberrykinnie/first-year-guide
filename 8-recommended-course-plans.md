# Recommended Course Plans
*Disclaimer: These are opinionated recommendations from CSSA executives based on years of observing student success patterns in our Discord community. Always finalize your schedule with an [academic advisor](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/advising/#current-students).*

## If Starting in Fall (Standard Path)
**Goal**: Complete 24 credits by May-June to declare your CS major before July registration.

### üóìÔ∏è Critical Sequencing
| Term      | Must-Take Courses               | Why This Order?                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fall**  | COMP 1010<br>MATH 1500          | COMP 1010 ‚Üí COMP 1020 chain can't be broken. MATH 1500 ‚Üí MATH 1700 is equally locked. |
| **Winter**| COMP 1020<br>MATH 1700          | Prerequisites completed in Fall                                                |

### üìö Standard First-Year Plan (Balanced)
```markdown
Fall (15cr):
- COMP 1010 (Intro CS I)
- MATH 1500 (Calculus I)
- MATH 1300 (Linear Algebra)
- STAT 1150 (Stats & Computing)   ‚Üê Required for COMP 2400!
- [W] Arts 1110 (Writing)

Winter (15cr):
- COMP 1020 (Intro CS II)
- MATH 1700 (Calculus II)
- MATH 1240 (Discrete Math)       ‚Üê Or move to Summer
- Elective (e.g., COMP 1002/1600)
- Elective

Summer (3cr):
- MATH 1240 (if not taken Winter) ‚Üê *Highly recommended as solo course*
```

### ‚ö° Tryhard Option (Only if confident!)
```markdown
Fall (18cr):
- COMP 1010 
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150
- [W] Arts 1110
- COMP 1500 (CS Field Survey)   ‚Üê Great for exploring specialties

Winter (18cr):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1240                    ‚Üê Only if strong in proofs
- COMP 1600 (CS & Society)
- COMP 1006 (Productivity Tools)
- Arts elective

Summer (6cr):
- COMP 2140 (Data Structures)  ‚Üê Requires COMP 1020
- COMP 2400 (Systems)          ‚Üê Requires COMP 1020 + STAT 1150
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Safer Path (If less math/programming confidence)
```markdown
Fall (12cr):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1080 (Intro to Proofs)  ‚Üê Easier prep for MATH 1240
- [W] Arts 1110

Winter (12cr):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150

Summer (3cr):
- MATH 1240                    ‚Üê Focus entirely on this
```

> **Summer Course Reality**:  
> - May-June and July-August are separate **condensed terms** (6 weeks each)  
> - Courses meet 300 mins/week instead of 150 mins/week  
> - **Never take more than one course per sub-term** - it's like two full-time jobs

## If Starting in Winter/Summer (Irregular Paths)
*Key principle: Sync with the next Fall cohort instead of rushing. COMP courses fill fastest - prioritize them.*

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Starting in Winter
```markdown
Year 1 Winter (9cr):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- Elective (e.g., [W] course)

Year 1 Summer (3cr):
- MATH 1240 (May-June)          ‚Üê Solo focus!

Year 1 Fall (9-12cr):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- STAT 1150
- MATH 1300 (if needed)

Year 2 Winter (9cr):
- MATH 1300/1240 (backup)
- Arts elective
- COMP elective
```
*Why this works*: Avoids overloading while hitting COMP chains. MATH 1240 alone in summer is more manageable than with 2 other courses.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Starting in Summer
```markdown
Year 1 Summer (6cr):
- COMP 1010 (May-Jun)
- COMP 1020 (Jul-Aug)          ‚Üê Take back-to-back while fresh

Year 1 Fall (9cr):
- MATH 1500
- MATH 1300
- STAT 1150                    ‚Üê Critical for COMP 2400

Year 1 Winter (9cr):
- MATH 1700
- MATH 1240
- [W] Arts course

Year 1 Summer (3cr):
- MATH 1240 backup (if needed)
```

### üê¢ Extended Pathway (For those needing flexibility)
```markdown
Year 1 Fall (9cr):
- COMP 1000 (CS Communication)
- MATH 1080 (Proofs Prep)
- [W] Arts course

Year 1 Winter (9cr):
- COMP 1010
- MATH 1500
- Arts elective

Year 1 Summer (3cr):
- MATH 1240

Year 2 Fall (9cr):
- COMP 1020
- MATH 1700
- STAT 1150

Year 2 Winter (9cr):
- MATH 1300
- COMP elective
- Elective
```
*Note*: COMP 1000 and MATH 1080 are preparatory - they don't count toward major requirements but build confidence.

## Critical Reminders
1. **Declare Before July**: Use Aurora or submit [this form](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/advising/#current-students) once you hit 24cr  
2. **Full-Time Status**: Need 9cr/term for scholarships/residency - plan accordingly  
3. **Backups Save GPAs**:  
   - Always register for next term's courses *while taking prerequisites* (e.g., take COMP 1010? Register for COMP 1020!)  
   - If struggling, drop before VW deadline (March/October) rather than risking GPA  
4. **Every Path Works**: Some take 4 years, others 5. Graduating with a strong GPA > rushing with burnout.  

**When in doubt**: Screenshot your planned schedule and ask in the [CS Discord](https://discord.umanitobacssa.ca/) - upper-years love to help!
